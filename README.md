This portfolio website showcases my projects, skills, and interests as a junior software developer. Built with Vue.js, it features a user-friendly interface with various components that highlight my work and provide essential information.

## Project Description

The portfolio includes sections for an image gallery, music player, project repository, resume viewer, and a contact form. Users can easily navigate through my projects, filter them, and view my resume directly on the site.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: For building the user interface and handling component logic.
- **Vue Router**: For managing navigation between different views.
- **Axios**: To fetch data from the GitHub API for project repositories.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality and interactivity within components.

## Key Features

- **Project Filter**: Users can search and filter projects by type and date.
- **Image Gallery**: A slideshow component that showcases photographs.
- **Music Player**: An embedded audio player with track navigation.
- **Resume Viewer**: An iframe to display my resume directly on the site.
- **Contact Form**: Allows users to reach out to me with their inquiries.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Fetching**: Initially struggled with fetching data from the GitHub API due to CORS issues. Resolved by configuring the API call properly.
- **Component Communication**: Learning to manage state and props effectively between components was a learning curve. Used Vue's reactive properties and event emissions to handle interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the layout is responsive across various devices took time and multiple iterations.
- **State Management**: Managing the state for multiple components (e.g., the music player and slideshow) was initially challenging. I overcame this by using Vue's reactive features effectively.
- **Embedding Audio and Video**: Setting up the audio player to handle different tracks and ensuring smooth transitions required additional logic and testing.

## Future Improvements

- **Blog Feature**: Adding a blog section to share insights and learnings from my development journey.
- **More Projects!**: Adding more increasingly complex projects to my portfolio (ie, CRUD app, API, etc) to showcase my learnings and progress.
